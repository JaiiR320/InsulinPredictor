			<p>For our project, we wanted to be able to predict the 
				future price of insulin based on the prices that have 
				been set currently and in the past. Being able to accurately 
				predict the price of insulin to a certain range would help 
				those in need be able to find the necessary medicine needed 
				to live at an affordable price. To predict the price of insulin, 
				our model would use the Fisher Price Index on a set of data. 
				The predicted price of insulin would be based on the data that 
				was given along with previous data already given to the model to 
				more accurately pick an accurate price. To measure the success of 
				our model, we would compare our models' predictions of older data
				to how the data turned out and based on that success, would give us a good understanding of how accurate it could be for data now to predict future prices.Â </p>
